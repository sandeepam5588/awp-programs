	<h2>Do You wanna know about me</h2>

		<p>Here is my childhood details. From the age 0 to 12 years is always the easiest time of year to declare the sky is falling,
			but it's worth noting the amount of exciting independent and small-scale projects that will get significant releases in
			these months, coming off successful runs at Sundance, in Austin, or even on the Internet. Andrew Bujalski's romantic comedy
			Results (May 29) warrants attention thanks to a magnetic lead performance from Cobie Smulders (who's right there with
			the Avengers battling Ultron the very same month). The Sundance winner Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (June 12) promises
			well-earned teenaged tears; the festival also produced the surprise hit Dope (June 19), a hip-hop-centered coming-of-age
			film. James Ponsoldt's The End of the Tour (July 31) will attract notice for Jason Segel's performance as the late literary
			legend David Foster Wallace, but hits hardest as a stunningly smart portrayal of the banalities and idiosyncrasies of
			clinical depression.</p>
